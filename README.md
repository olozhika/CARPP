# CARPP: Core Analysis via Radiative Transfer and Profile Parameters

**CARPP** is a powerful tool for analyzing dense molecular cores using multi-wavelength dust continuum observations. It leverages 3D radiative transfer under spherical symmetry to derive accurate density, temperature, and spectral index profiles, enabling researchers to distinguish between hydrostatic equilibrium (Bonnor-Ebert spheres) and dynamically collapsing cores (power-law profiles).

## 🌟 Features

- **3D Radiative Transfer Modeling**: Accurately accounts for temperature gradients and optical depth effects.
- **Multi-Wavelength Data Fitting**: Optimizes density and temperature profiles using dust continuum images at different wavelengths.
- **Flexible Profile Models**:
  - Generalized Plummer-like density profiles (supports Bonnor-Ebert spheres and power-law regimes).
  - Continuous temperature profiles with customizable central and ambient parameters.
- **Robust Performance**: Achieves <10% average parameter error under optimal noise/resolution conditions.
