# CARPP
CARPP: Core Analysis via Radiative transfer and Profile Parameters! A 3D radiative transfer molecular core analyzing tool through multi-wavelength dust continuum data. It retrieves density profile and helps distinguishing hydrostatic equilibrium (Bonnor-Ebert spheres) from collapsing cores (power-law regimes).
